Made for team 1333 for the year 2022-2023, created by JJfriends (some random 9th grader)

These scripts do most things like:
- Adapter settings
- Auditing
- Windows Features
- Port Disabling
- Disable Dangrous Services
- Firewall
- Random Shit
- lockoutpolicy
- UAC/WIFI settings
- Windows Defender




## Idk

Will add some more shit if I need to ig, but this is what I have and I have homework to turn in.

I made this so I don't have to worry about the cyberpatriot police coming after my ass.
